<p><em>Watch your step, Florida.</em></p>
<p>In case you were wondering, my Spirit Quest was a huge success and I am returning to reality refreshed AND with the knowledge of my spirit animal. I think it was a coyote, but it was pretty flat and there were a lot of tire tracks.</p>
<p>In news that required way too much watching dogs circle and squat, researchers have discovered that the majority of dogs<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/dogs-poop-in-alignment-with-earths-magnetic-field">&nbsp;align themselves with earth's north/south magnetic field</a>&nbsp;before opening the gates to their brownie factories. Anybody have Little Debbie Fudge Brownies in their lunchbox today? I'll be taking those.</p>
<blockquote>...the researchers measured the direction of the body axis of 70 dogs from 37 breeds during 1,893 defecations and 5,582 urinations over the course of two years, and found that dogs "prefer to excrete with the body being aligned along the North-south axis under calm magnetic field conditions." They fittingly published their results in the journal Frontiers in Zoology.
<p><br /><em>It is still enigmatic why the dogs do align at all, whether they do it 'consciously' (i.e., whether the magnetic field is sensorial perceived (the dogs 'see,' 'hear' or 'smell' the compass direction or perceive it as a haptic stimulus) or whether its reception is controlled on the vegetative level (they 'feel better/more comfortable or worse/less comfortable' in a certain direction). Our analysis of the raw data (not shown here) indicates that dogs not only prefer N-S direction, but at the same time they also avoid E-W direction.</em></p>

<p>Apparently, all the studies were conducted on dogs that were off-leash and in the middle of a field with no fire hydrants or trees, so don't think your dog is special if it pees or shits facing east. If it shits in my yard though I will come out and yell at you.</p>
<p>Thanks to Rob, who agrees they should only install toilets in north/south facing directions so people stop peeing on the floor.</p>
