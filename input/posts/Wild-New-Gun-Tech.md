<p>Called the Mi-Bullet, the round acts somewhat like a multi-pellet buckshot, but the separate fragments of the round are connected and will expand to a pre-determined diameter after the bullet is fired. The Mi-Bullet expands to a diameter of 14 inches when fired from handguns and 24 inches from shotguns. [It] maintains its accuracy by utilizing an accelerated radial spread aided by the rifled barrel, officials say. The larger diameter makes it harder to miss, the company said.</p>
